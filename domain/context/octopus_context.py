    We need to source context for the LLM from multiple locations. "Static" resources are defined using Terraform,
    as this is a publicly documented format the LLM may have had an opportunity to scrape that also has the benefit of
    explicitly defining the relationship between resources. "Dynamic" resources like deployments and releases are
    sourced from the Octopus API as these can not be defined in HCL.

    The LLM messages are also tailored here to guide the LLM in how it processes the context.

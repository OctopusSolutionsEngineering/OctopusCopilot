# means the requests can not be returned to the Copilot interface.
# Another issue here is the Azure event driven scaling.
# As noted at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/event-driven-scaling?tabs=azure-cli#understanding-scaling-behaviors
# HTTP triggers will scale out once per second. We may be in a position of having HTTP requests queued behind a

# Testing revealed that the GPT 3.5 LLM struggles to extract meaningful values from large blobs of log outputs. For example,
# this query fails:
# find any CVEs in the deployment logs for the latest deployment of the project "Octopus Copilot Function" to the "Production" environment in the "Octopus Copilot" space in the last 400 lines
# But this query succeeds:
# find any CVEs in the deployment logs for the latest deployment of the project "Octopus Copilot Function" to the "Production" environment in the "Octopus Copilot" space in the last 300 lines
# A max_log_lines limit of 250 is appropriate for GPT 3.5.
# The GPT-4o was better though. We set a much higher limit before displaying a warning.

        * Show me the username for the git credential called "GitHub Creds".
        * List the certificates in the space "MySpace".
        * Which targets deploy to the "Production" environment in the space "MySpace"?
        * Show a table of the library variable sets that contain database connection strings.
        * Which runbooks create infrastructure with Terraform?

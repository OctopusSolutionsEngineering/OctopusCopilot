Answer:
The action with the name "My Sample Step" has a property called "Octopus.Action.AutoRetry.MaximumCount" set to "3". Because the "Octopus.Action.AutoRetry.MaximumCount" property is greater than 0, this action has step reties enabled.
The action with the name "Step 2" does not have a property called "Octopus.Action.AutoRetry.MaximumCount" defined. Because the "Octopus.Action.AutoRetry.MaximumCount" property is not defined, this action does not have step reties enabled.
The action with the name "Retry the login" does not have a property called "Octopus.Action.AutoRetry.MaximumCount" defined. Because the "Octopus.Action.AutoRetry.MaximumCount" property is not defined, this action does not have step reties enabled.
The action with the name "Restart the service" does not have a property called "Octopus.Action.AutoRetry.MaximumCount" defined. Because the "Octopus.Action.AutoRetry.MaximumCount" property is not defined, this action does not have step reties enabled.

The steps with retries enabled are:
- My Sample Step

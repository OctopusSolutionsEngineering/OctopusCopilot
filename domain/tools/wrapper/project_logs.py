        Use this function when the prompt asks anything about deployment or project logs. Some example prompts are:
        * Print the last 30 lines of text from the deployment logs of the latest project deployment to the "Production" environment.
        * Print the deployment logs of the latest project deployment.
        * Summarize the deployment logs of the latest deployment.
        * Find any urls in the deployment logs of release version "1.0.2" to the "Development" environment for the "Contoso" tenant for the "Web App" project in the "Hotfix" channel.

        You will be penalized for selecting the function when the prompt is asking about release versions.
        You must only select this function when the prompt is related to deployment logs.

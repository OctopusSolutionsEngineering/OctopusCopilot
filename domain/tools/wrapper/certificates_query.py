Answer:
First, assume all certificates belong to the space called "Demo".

Second, find the "octopusdeploy_certificate" resources that have an empty "environments" attribute, which indicates the certificate is not scoped to any environment.
The "octopusdeploy_certificate" "certificate_unscoped_certificate" resource has an empty "environments" attribute. This certificate is included in the results.
The "octopusdeploy_certificate" "certificate_global_certificate" resource has an empty "environments" attribute. This certificate is included in the results.

Third, find the environment with the name "Test".
The "octopusdeploy_environment" resource called "environment_test" has the name "Test".
This is the environment that the targets must reference in their "environments" attribute.

Fourth, find the "octopusdeploy_certificate" resources that have an "environments" attribute that references the "octopusdeploy_environment" resource called "environment_test".
The "octopusdeploy_certificate" "certificate_my_certificate" resource has an "environments" attribute that references the "octopusdeploy_environment" resource called "environment_test". This certificate is included in the results.
The "octopusdeploy_certificate" "certificate_another_certificate" resource has an "environments" attribute that references the "octopusdeploy_environment" resource called "environment_test". This certificate is included in the results.

The targets that belong to the "Test" environment are:
- Name: "My certificate" ID: "Certificates-18477"
- Name: "Another certificate" ID: "Certificates-12333"
- Name: "Unscoped certificate" ID: "Certificates-12323"
- Name: "Global certificate" ID: "Certificates-12324"

Question: What targets are defined in the space "Demo"?

Answer:
First, assume all targets belong to the space called "Demo".

Second, find all the certificates, which are represented by "octopusdeploy_certificate" resources.

The targets that belong to the "Demo" space are:
- Name: "My certificate" ID: "Certificates-18477"
- Name: "Another certificate" ID: "Certificates-12333"
- Name: "Dev certificate" ID: "Certificates-18323"

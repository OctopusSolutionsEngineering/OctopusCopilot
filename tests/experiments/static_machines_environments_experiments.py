    This test case is used to run experiments against the LLM.

    Unlike other tests, the "test cases" in this class are not expected to be run to validate the correctness of the
    application. Instead, they are used to validate hypotheses and run experiments. Importantly, failed experiments
    are kept here as a reference.

    For this reason, the tests are disabled by not having a suffix of "_test", which prevents them being run by the
    CI/CD process. They can be run manually in the IDE.

    Executive Summary
    -----------------

    GPT 3.5 displayed some unusual behaviour where it detected patterns in the names of groups of targets and
    excluded "odd" targets that didn't match the pattern. Changing the order in which targets were processed by moving
    the "odd" targets to the start of the context changed the outcome by allowing the "odd" targets to be included in
    the answer. Renaming the "odd" targets to match the pattern also allowed them to be included in the answer.

    Although it is not captured in these test cases (I found and fixed the bug), having a context where some, but not
    all, targets lacked the id attribute also impacted the answer. The LLM would not include a target without an ID,
    presumably because the question asked for the ID in the answer.

    Observations:
    * A chain-of-thought and few-shot prompt helped the LLM to generate the correct answer.
    * Reducing the context size by removing unrelated targets also helped.
    * Ensuring the context was consistent (with every target having an ID) helped.

        This test generally passes, but not because it returned the correct information.

        This test presents a list of octopusdeploy_target machines that are not scoped to the "Development" environment.
        The only difference between them is the resource name and the machine name. Six of the machines have the prefix
        "pos-dev-", while the seventh machine is called "azure_iis".

        The LLM excludes the "azure_iis" machine from the results. My assumption here is that it has identified the
        naming convention used by the other machines and excluded the "azure_iis" machine because it doesn't fit the
        pattern.

###
Answer 1:
First, find the environment with the name "Development".  The "octopusdeploy_environment" resource has the name "Development". This is the environment that the targets must be assigned to.
Second, find the following resources that represent targets or machines:
- "octopusdeploy_cloud_region_deployment_target"
- "octopusdeploy_polling_tentacle_deployment_target"
- "octopusdeploy_kubernetes_cluster_deployment_target"
- "octopusdeploy_ssh_connection_deployment_target"
- "octopusdeploy_listening_tentacle_deployment_target"
- "octopusdeploy_offline_package_drop_deployment_target"
- "octopusdeploy_azure_cloud_service_deployment_target"
- "octopusdeploy_azure_service_fabric_cluster_deployment_target"
- "octopusdeploy_azure_web_app_deployment_target"
Third, filter the resources based on the "environments" attribute to find the targets belonging to the "Development" environment.

The targets that belong to the "Test" environment are:
- Name: "sydney-client-5" ID: "Machines-18477"
- Name: "Web App" ID: "Machines-18962"
- Name: "Web App 2" ID: "Machines-19002"
- Name: "Worker Cluster" ID: "Machines-18963"
- Name: "Linux Jump Box" ID: "Machines-18964"
- Name: "Database" ID: "Machines-18965"
- Name: "Remote Site" ID: "Machines-18966"
- Name: "Old Azure Service" ID: "Machines-18967"
- Name: "Finance Cluster" ID: "Machines-18968"
- Name: "New Web App" ID: "Machines-14526"

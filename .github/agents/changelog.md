You are an expert Python developer and technical writer. Your task is to review the following git diffs and generate a changelog entry that summarizes the changes made in the code. The changelog entry should be concise, clear, and informative, highlighting the key modifications, additions, or deletions in the code.

From Octopus, get the latest release of the project "Octopus Copilot Function" in the space "Octopus Copilot".
Get the list of commits associated with that release.
From GitHub, get the diff of each commit.
Using the diffs, generate a changelog entry.
In GitHub, create a branch based on the version of the Octopus release in the format "x.y.z-changelog", for example, "0.1.45-changelog".
In GitHub, add the changelog entry to a file with the name of the Octopus release version in the format "x.y.z.md", for example "0.1.45.md", in the "docs" folder.
In GitHub, create a pull request to merge the new branch into the main branch with the title "Changelog for version x.y.x", for example "Changelog for version 0.1.45", and the body containing the changelog entry.

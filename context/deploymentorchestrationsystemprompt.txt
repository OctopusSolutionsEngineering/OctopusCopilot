* The supplied "Example Octopus Deployment Orchestration Terraform Configuration" is the primary source of truth for the configuration.

## Deployment Orchestration Project Step Instructions

* Orchestration projects contain steps of type "Octopus.DeployRelease" that deploy a child project.
* Each "Octopus.DeployRelease" step must have a "Octopus.Action.DeployRelease.ProjectId" execution property and a "primary_package" with the "package_id" set to the child project ID.
* The ID of the child project can be obtained from a data "octopusdeploy_projects" data source.
* The following is an example of a "Octopus.DeployRelease" step that references a data "octopusdeploy_projects" data source for the child project ID and a data "octopusdeploy_feeds" data source for the feed ID:

```
# This data source is used to find an existing parent project by its name.
data "octopusdeploy_projects" "project_every_step_project" {
  ids          = null
  partial_name = "Orchestrator Project"
  skip         = 0
  take         = 1
}

# This data source find the built-in Octopus Server Releases feed.
data "octopusdeploy_feeds" "feed_octopus_server_releases__built_in_" {
  feed_type    = "OctopusProject"
  ids          = null
  partial_name = "Octopus Server Releases"
  skip         = 0
  take         = 1
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      error_message = "Failed to resolve a feed called \"Octopus Server Releases (built-in)\". This resource must exist in the space before this Terraform configuration is applied."
      condition     = length(self.feeds) != 0
    }
  }
}

# This data source is used to find an existing child project by its name.
data "octopusdeploy_projects" "project_every_step_project" {
  ids          = null
  # Replace this attribute with the name of the project you want to deploy
  partial_name = "Child project name"
  skip         = 0
  take         = 1
}

# This resource creates a step that deploys the child project.
resource "octopusdeploy_process_step" "process_step_every_step_project_deploy_a_release" {
  count                 = "${length(data.octopusdeploy_projects.project_every_step_project.projects) != 0 ? 0 : 1}"
  name                  = "Deploy a Release"
  type                  = "Octopus.DeployRelease"
  process_id            = "${length(data.octopusdeploy_projects.project_every_step_project.projects) != 0 ? null : octopusdeploy_process.process_every_step_project[0].id}"
  channels              = null
  condition             = "Success"
  environments          = null
  excluded_environments = null
  notes                 = "This step is used to deploy a release of a child project."
  package_requirement   = "LetOctopusDecide"
  primary_package       = {
    acquisition_location = "NotAcquired",
    # The feed_id is set to the built-in Octopus Server Releases feed found in the data source
    feed_id = "${data.octopusdeploy_feeds.feed_octopus_server_releases__built_in_.feeds[0].id}",
    id = null,
    # The package_id is set to the child project ID found via the data source
    package_id = "${data.octopusdeploy_projects.project_child_project.projects[0].id}",
    properties = null
  }
  slug                  = "deploy-a-release"
  start_trigger         = "StartAfterPrevious"
  tenant_tags           = null
  properties            = {
      }
  execution_properties  = {
        "Octopus.Action.RunOnServer" = "true"
        "Octopus.Action.DeployRelease.DeploymentCondition" = "Always"
        # The "Octopus.Action.DeployRelease.ProjectId" property is set to the child project ID found via the data source
        "Octopus.Action.DeployRelease.ProjectId" = "${data.octopusdeploy_projects.project_child_project.projects[0].id}"
      }
}
```

* The "Octopus.Action.DeployRelease.ProjectId" and "package_id" properties must reference only a data source.
* You will be penalized for setting the "Octopus.Action.DeployRelease.ProjectId" or "package_id" property to something like `"${length(data.octopusdeploy_projects.project_reporting_microservice.projects) != 0 ? data.octopusdeploy_projects.project_reporting_microservice.projects[0].id : octopusdeploy_project.project_reporting_microservice[0].id}"`
* You will be penalized for setting the "Octopus.Action.DeployRelease.ProjectId" property to a fixed value like "Projects-8916", "Projects-8915", and "Projects-8917".
* You will be penalized for setting the "feed_id" attribute in the "primary_package" block to a fixed value like "Feeds-5936", "Feeds-5678", and "Feeds-91011".
* You must not recreate the following, as these resources and data sources are only used to demonstrate the orchestration project step:
    * data "octopusdeploy_projects" "project_child_project"
    * resource "octopusdeploy_project" "project_child_project"
* You must always include the `data "octopusdeploy_feeds" "feed_octopus_server_releases__built_in_"` data source.
* The "feed_id" attribute in the "primary_package" block must always be set to the built-in Octopus Server Releases feed found in the `data "octopusdeploy_feeds" "feed_octopus_server_releases__built_in_"` data source.
